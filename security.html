<h1>Security Assessment of 2048 Gamecenter</h1>

<h3>Prepared by Jaime Sanchez 4/25/2014</h3><br>



<h2>Introduction</h2>
<hr>
<p> This assessment tests the security of http://fathomless-reaches-5908.herokuapp.com , a web application developed by Mr. Nana Kwakwa. The nature of the application is to serve as an API to recieve and display scores for the popular <a href="http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">2048</a> game that has become viral in the recent weeks.</p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<hr>
The pentesting was done with the resources an attacker would have available at the time of an attack. That is, the website's URL, the sitemap, and the routes used for posting and getting, along with other factors like the envoirnment used (heroku and monogolab). 

<h2>Abstract of Findings </h2>
<hr>
The testing if the website gave a pretty good idea of ways to attack it and therefore hinder it. There are some serious Issues that could render the website useless/inactive. The most dangerous is the code injection which allows an attacker to alter the client's code. Other attacks include overflowing the database with so much information that it collapses and also the mishandling of bad input can cause the website to crash. That being said, there are other underlyinng issues with the website, mainly, no authentication. 
<h2>Issues Found</h2>
<hr> 
<p> </p>
<ol>
	<li><p><strong>Database Overflow </strong></p></li>
	<ul>	
		<p>This attack consisted on a repeated post request to the server to save entries in the database, in hope of causing an overflow in the client's database. There is one caveat here though: The size of the database vs the size of the post requests. </p>
		<li><h5>Location / page where issue was found</h5></li>
			<p>http://fathomless-reaches-5908.herokuapp.com/submit.json</p>
		<li><h5>Severity of issue </h5></li>
				<p> Moderate, this  issue poses a  cost overhead on the server's owener(supposing he is paying for the space). Aside from creating database space issues, the server as it is now allows requests to be done by anyone. NO form of authentication is needed to post to the database. Also, this issue shows that the server does not handle 
				database overload and therefore crashes the website.
		<li><h5>Description of issue. </h5></li>
				This attack needed a lot of time to be done as the size of the starter heroku MongoLabs database was of a considerate size, 450MB. It took around 50,000 requests of 10 kilobytes each, to bring the database to a halt, and cause heroku to raise errors. 
		<li><h5>Proof of vulnerability. </h5></li>
			<p> The following bash script was used to do multiple curl requests. The INPUT shown is shortened for sake of presentation. The actual request size was made up to be of 10 kylobytes per payload. </p>
<div class="box"><pre class="prettyprint lang-sh"><xmp>#!/bin/bash
$INPUT = "JAIMEJAIMEJAIMEJAIMEJAIMEJAIMEJAIMEJAIMEJAIMEJAIME\
JAIMEJAIMEJAIMEJAIMEJAIMEJAIMEJAIMEJAIMEJAIMEJAIMEJAIMEJAIME\

for (( c=1; c<=$1 ; c++ ))
do
   echo "Send data x $c "
   curl --data "username=$INPUT&score=$INPUT&grid=$INPUT"  \
   http://fathomless-reaches-5908.herokuapp.com/submit.json
done</xmp></pre></div>
			<p> After many requests, the target db started experiencing issues: </p>
			<img src="dbcrash.jpg">
		<li><h5>Resolution. </h5></li>
		<p> This could easily be fixed by adding a layer of authentication and also a spam detector that bans an IP address that does a repeated-high-volume amount of requests to the server. Moreover, the client should implement a way to deal with the database getting full.  <p>
	<ul>	

	</ul>


<li><p><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via JS injection </strong></p></li>
		<p>This attack consisted on inserting a script tag containing malicious JS code in the post request as one of it's parameters.</p>
		<li><h5>Location / page where issue was found</h5></li>
			<p>http://fathomless-reaches-5908.herokuapp.com/submit.json and hc/p> 
		<li><h5>Severity of issue </h5></li>
			<p> High. This is a significant security risk. The attacker could do an array of things by injecting malicious JS to redirect to another website, to alter the funcionality of the node.js application or to even gain access to the database.  </p>
		<li><h5>Description of issue. </h5></li>
			<p>Attack initiated through a Post request to the /submit.json route. A database entry containing js code was inserted into the server's databse using the curl POST functionality. The attack works like a time bomb, activated when the user loads anything from the database into their page. When a db entry  containing the tag with the code injuection display, the code gets run by the client. In this case, The JS code is set to redirect the page to <a href="http://www.reddit.com">reddit</a> . This issue will now affect anywone doing a GET request to the http://fathomless-reaches-5908.herokuapp.com/ page. 
		<li><h5>Proof of vulnerability. </h5></li>
			<p>Curl request used to insert malicious code:</p>
			<div class="box"><pre class="prettyprint lang-sh"><xmp>curl --data "username=a&score=yesss&grid=<script type="text/javascript">window.location="http://www.reddit.com";</script>" http://fathomless-reaches-5908.herokuapp.com/submit.json</xmp></pre></div>
		<li><h5>Resolution. </h5></li>
			<p> This attack was possible because of the lack of input validation done by the server. The fix to this issue is to escape the input. The cross scripting portion of this could be fixed by altering the CORS so that inseat of "*" it is set to specific domains. </p>
	</ul>
<li><p><strong>Invalid JSON</strong></p></li>
	<ul>	
		Using bad JSON format throw's exception in JSON parser. 
		<li><h5>Location / page where issue was found</h5></li>
				GET http://fathomless-reaches-5908.herokuapp.com
		<li><h5>Severity of issue </h5></li>
			Moderate. The attack results in server crash. 
		<li><h5>Description of issue. </h5></li>
			The server fails to handle badly formatted JSON. The input is saved in the db as JSON,  therefore, an attack might be triggered by raising an exception in the server's JSON parser. 
		<li><h5>Proof of vulnerability. </h5></li>
		<p>Curl request used to insert malicious code:</p>
			<div class="box"><pre class="prettyprint lang-sh"><xmp>curl --data "username=a\"&score=yesss&grid=a'a" http://fathomless-reaches-5908.herokuapp.com/submit.json</xmp></pre></div>
		<li><h5>Resolution. </h5></li>
		This can be fixed by escaping the collected input.
	</ul>


</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<hr> 
In conclusion, this website has pretty profound security risks:
<ol>
<li> Anyone can insert to the database. </li>
<li> There is no way to handle the event in which the database is full. </li>
<li> Input in Post requests is not parsed for validity leading to injection vulnerabilities and bad format errors. </li>
</ol>
These can be fixed easily by doing the following:
<ol>
<li> Implementing an authentication system to the API. So only poeple with keys can use it. </li>
<li> Escaping input so that code injections are rendered useless. </li>
<li> Providing an error routine for when database is full </li>
</ol>
